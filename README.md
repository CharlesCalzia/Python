# Python Scripts

All programs are written in ![Python 3.6](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3.5-yellow.svg)

## to install modules run:

` pip install -r requirements.txt `

You might have to use `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` If your computer has both Python 2 and 3 installed. 

## A message from shreydan:

- All scripts are written by me with sufficient amount of comments.
- _**Star**_ this repository if you found any of the code to be helpful.
- Please _**contribute**_ by **_forking_** this repository.
- If you need help in understanding any part of the scripts, raise an _**issue**_ and I'll explain.
